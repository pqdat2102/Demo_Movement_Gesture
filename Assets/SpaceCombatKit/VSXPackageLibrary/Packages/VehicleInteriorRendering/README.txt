The Vehicle Interior Rendering system provides a way to navigate inside moving vehicles with any character, by creating a static duplicate of the 
vehicle interior inside which the character actually moves, and layering the rendering of multiple cameras to make it appear as if the player is inside the moving
vehicle.
